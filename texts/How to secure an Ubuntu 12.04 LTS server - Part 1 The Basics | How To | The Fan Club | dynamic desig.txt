How to secure an Ubuntu 12.04 LTS server — Part 1 The Basics

Submitted by The Fan Club on Thu, 2012—05—17 13:06

 

This guide is based on various community forum posts and webpages. Special thanks to all. All comments
and improvements are very welcome as this is purely a personal experimental project at this point and must

be considered a work in progress.

This guide is intended as a relatively easy step by step guide to:

Harden the security on an Ubuntu 12.04 LTS server by installing and configuring the following:

Install and configure Firewall — ufw

Secure shared memory — fstab

SSH — Key based login, disable root login and Change port

Apache SSL — Disable SSL V3 support

Protect su by limiting access only to admin group

Harden network with sysctl settings

Disable Open DNS Recursion and Remove Version Info — Bind9 DNS
Prevent IP Spoofing

Harden PHP for security

Restrict Apache Information Leakage

Ileqtdrenlenta

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS or later server with a standard LAMP stack installed.

 

1. Firewall - UFW

A good place to start is to install a Firewall.

UFW — Uncomplicated Firewall is a basic firewall that works very well and easy to configure with its
Firewall configuration tool — gufw, or use Shorewall, fwbuilder, or Firestarter.

Use Firestarter GUI to configure your firewall or refer to the Ubuntu Server Guide, UFW manual

p_ag§_(mp_:/_/manp_ages.ubuntu.com/manp_ag§/Drecise /en/man8 /ufw.8.html) or the Ubuntu

Install UFW and enable, open a terminal window and enter :

sudo apt—get install ufw

Allow SSH and Http services.

sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw allow http

Enable the firewall.

sudo ufw enable

Check the status of the firewall.

sudo ufw status verbose

2. Secure shared memory.

Shared memory can be used in an attack against a running service. Modify /etc/fstab to make it more
secure.

Open a Terminal Window and enter the following :

sudo vi /etc/fstab

Add the following line and save. You will need to reboot for this setting to take effect :
Note : This only is works in Ubuntu 12.04 — For later Ubuntu versions
replace /dev/shm with /run/shm

Save and Reboot when done

tmpfs /dev/shm tmpfs defaults,noexec,nosuid 0 0

3. SSH Hardening - key based login, disable root login and change port.

If you have to use password authentication, the easiest way to secure SSH is to disable root login and
Change the SSH port to something different than the standard port 22.

Before disabling the root login create a new SSH user and make sure the user belongs to the admin
group (see 5qu 4. below regarding the admin group).

if you Change the SSH port keep the port number below 1024 as these are priviledged ports that can
only be opened by root or processes running as root.

If you Change the SSH port also open the new port you have Chosen on the firewall and Close port 22.

Open a Terminal Window and enter :

sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Change or add the following and save.

Port <ENTER YOUR PORT>
Protocol 2
PermitRootLogin no
DebianBanner no

Restart SSH server, open a Terminal Window and enter :

sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart

4. Apache SSL Hardening - disable SSL v3 support.

0 The SSL V3 protocol has been proven to be insecure.
0 We will disable Apache support for the protocol and force the use of the newer protocols.

0 Open a Terminal Window and enter :

sudo vi /etc/apache2/mods—available/ssl.conf

0 Change this line from :

SSLProtocol all —SSLv2

0 To the following and save.

SSLProtocol all —SSLv2 —SSLv3

0 Restart the Apache server, open a Terminal Window and enter :

sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

5. Protect su by limiting access only to admin group.

0 To limit the use of su by admin users only we need to create an admin group, then add users and limit
the use of su to the admin group.

0 Add a admin group to the system and add your own admin username to the group by replacing <YOUR
ADMIN USERNAME> below with your admin username.

0 Open a terminal window and enter:

sudo groupadd admin
sudo usermod —a —G admin <YOUR ADMIN USERNAME>
sudo dpkg—statoverride ——update ——add root admin 4750 /bin/su

6. Harden network with sysctl settings.

0 The /etc/sysctl.c0nf file contain all the sysctl settings.
0 Prevent source routing of incoming packets and log malformed lP's enter the following in a terminal

window:

sudo vi /etc/sysctl.conf

0 Edit the /etc/sysctl.conf file and un—comment or add the following lines :

# IP Spoofing protection
net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 1
net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 1

# Ignore ICMP broadcast requests
net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts = 1

# Disable source packet routing

net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route 0
net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route 0
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route = 0
net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_source_route

II
S

# Ignore send redirects
net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects = 0
net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects = 0

# Block SYN attacks
net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1
net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 2048
net.ipv4.tcp_synack_retries = 2
net.ipv4.tcp_syn_retries = 5

# Log Martians
net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians = 1
net.ipv4.icmp_ignore_bogus_error_responses = 1

# Ignore ICMP redirects

net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects 0
net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_redirects 0
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_redirects = 0
net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_redirects

II
S

# Ignore Directed pings
net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_all = 1

0 To reload sysctl with the latest changes, enter:

sudo sysctl —p

7. Disable Open DNS Recursion and Remove Version Info - BIND DNS

Server.

0 Open a Terminal and enter the following :

sudo vi /etc/bind/named.conf.options

0 Add the following to the Options section :

recursion no;
version ”Not Disclosed”;

0 Restart BIND DNS server. Open a Terminal and enter the following :

sudo /etc/init.d/bind9 restart

8. Prevent IP Spoofing.

0 Open a Terminal and enter the following :

sudo vi /etc/host.conf

0 Add or edit the following lines :

order bind,hosts
nospoof on

9. Harden PHP for security.
0 Edit the php.ini file :

sudo vi /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini

0 Add or edit the following lines an save :

disable_functions = exec,system,shell_exec,passthru
register_globals = Off

expose_php = Off

display_errors = Off

track_errors = Off
html_errors = Off
magic_quotes_gpc = Off

0 Restart Apache server. Open a Terminal and enter the following :

sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

10. Restrict Apache Information Leakage.

0 Edit the Apache2 configuration security file :

sudo vi /etc/apache2/conf.d/security

0 Add or edit the following lines and save :

ServerTokens Prod
ServerSignature Off
TraceEnable Off
Header unset ETag
FileETag None

0 Restart Apache server. Open a Terminal and enter the following :

sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

11. Web Application Firewall - ModSecurity.

0 See : How to install anache2 mod securitv and mod evasive on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS server

12. Protect from DDOS (Denial of Service) attacks - ModEvasive

0 See : How to install anache2 mod securitv and mod evasive on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS server

13. Scan logs and ban suspicious hosts - DenyHosts and FaiIZBan.

 

attacks by adding entries to /etC/hosts.deny. DenyHosts will also inform LinuX administrators about
offending hosts, attacked users and suspicious logins.

0 Open a Terminal and enter the following :

sudo apt—get install denyhosts

After installation edit the configuration file /etc/denyhosts.conf and Change the email, and other
settings as required.

To edit the admin email settings open a terminal window and enter:

sudo vi /etc/denyhosts.conf

Change the following values as required on your server :

ADMIN_EMAIL = root@localhost

SMTP_HOST = localhost

SMTP_PORT = 25

#SMTP_USERNAME=foo

#SMTP_PASSWORD=bar

SMTP_FROM = DenyHosts nobody@localhost
#SYSLOG_REPORT=YES

Failean (httD://www.fai12ban.org/wiki/index.ohn/Main Pagg)_is more advanced than DenyHosts as it
extends the log monitoring to other services including SSH, Apache, Courier, FTP, and more.
Failean scans log files and bans IPs that show the malicious signs —— too many password failures,
seeking for exploits, etc.

Generally Fail2Ban then used to update firewall rules to reject the IP addresses for a specified amount of
time, although any arbitrary other action could also be configured.

Out of the box Fail2Ban comes with filters for various services (apache, courier, ftp, ssh, etc).

Open a Terminal and enter the following :

sudo apt—get install fail2ban

After installation edit the configuration file /etc/fai12ban/jail.local and create the filter rules as
required.

To edit the settings open a terminal window and enter:

sudo vi /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf

Activate all the services you would like fail2ban to monitor by Changing enabled : false to enabled :
true
For example if you would like to enable the SSH monitoring and banning jail, find the line below and

change enabled from false to true. Thats it.

[ssh]

enabled = true
port = ssh
filter = sshd

logpath = /var/log/auth.log
maxretry = 3

If you have selected a non-standard SSH port in step 3 then you need to Change the port setting in
fail2ban from ssh which by default is port 22, to your new port number, for example if you have Chosen
1234 then port = 1234

[ssh]

enabled = true

port = <ENTER YOUR SSH PORT NUMBER HERE>
filter = sshd

logpath = /var/log/auth.log
maxretry = 3

If you would like to receive emails from FailZBan if hosts are banned Change the following line to your

email address.

destemail = root@localhost

and Change the following line from :

action %(action_)s

to:

action %(action_mwl)s

You can also create rule filters for the various services that you would like fail2ban to monitor that is

not supplied by default.

sudo vi /etc/fail2ban/jail.local

Good instructions on how to configure fail2ban and create the various filters can be found on

HowtoForgQ (httn://www.howtoforge.com/) — click here for an example

When done with the configuration of Fail2Ban restart the service with :

sudo /etc/init.d/fail2ban restart

You can also Check the status with.

sudo fail2ban—client status

14. Intrusion Detection - PSAD.

Cipherdvne PSAD (http://www.cipherdvne.org/psad/_)_is a collection of three lightweight system daemons
that run on LinuX machines and analyze iptables log messages to detect port scans and other suspicious
traffic.

Currently version 2.1 causes errors during install on Ubuntu 12.04, but apparently does work. Version 2.2
resolves these issues but is not yet available on the Ubuntu software repositories. It is recommended to
manually compile and install version 2.2 from the source files available on the Qpe_rdyne website

(httD: / /WWW.CiDhel‘dVl’le.Ol‘2' /Dsad/download/_)_.

To install the latest version from the source files follow these instruction : How to install PSAD
Intrusion Detection on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS server

OR install the older version from the Ubuntu software repositories, open a Terminal and enter the

following :

sudo apt—get install psad

Then for basic configuration see How to install PSAD Intrusion Detection on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

server and follow from step 2:

15. Check for rootkits - RKHunter and CHKRootKit.

Both RKHunter_(http://rkhunter.sourceforge.net/_)_and CHKROOtkit (http://www.chkrootkit.org/_)_basically
do the same thing — Check your system for rootkits (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit)_. No harm in
using both.

Open a Terminal and enter the following :

sudo apt—get install rkhunter chkrootkit

To run chkrootkit open a terminal window and enter :

sudo chkrootkit

0 To update and run RKHunter. Open a Terminal and enter the following :

sudo rkhunter ——update
sudo rkhunter ——propupd
sudo rkhunter ——check

16. Scan open ports - Nmap.

0 Nmap_(mp_:/_/nma1mg/_)_("Network Mapper") is a free and open source utility for network discovery and
security auditing.

0 Open a Terminal and enter the following :

sudo apt—get install nmap

0 Scan your system for open ports with :

nmap —v —sT localhost

0 SYN scanning with the following :

sudo nmap —v —sS localhost

17. Analyse system LOG files - LogWatch.

parses through your system's logs and creates a report analyzing areas that you specify. Logwatch is easy
to use and will work right out of the package on most systems.

0 Open a Terminal and enter the following :

sudo apt—get install logwatch libdate—manip—perl

0 To View logwatch output use less :

sudo logwatch | less

To email a logwatch report for the past 7 days to an email address, enter the following and replace

mail@domain.c0m with the required email. :

sudo logwatch ——mailto mail@domain.com ——output mail ——format html ——
range 'between —7 days and today'

18. SELinux - Apparmor.

National Securitv Agency (httpz//www.nsa.gov/research/selinux/index.shtml)_(NSA) has taken LinuX to
the next level with the introduction of Security—Enhanced Linux (SELinux). SELinux takes the existing
GNU/LinuX operating system and extends it with kernel and user—space modifications to make it bullet—
proof.

More information can be found here. Ubuntu Server Guide - Apparmor

It is installed by default since Ubuntu 7.04.

Open a Terminal and enter the following :

sudo apt—get install apparmor apparmor—profiles

Check to see if things are running :

sudo apparmor_status

19. Audit your system security - Tiger.

ng_(ﬂp_:/_/www.nongnu.org/LiggLLis a security tool that can be use both as a security audit and

 

intrusion detection system.

Open a Terminal and enter the following :

sudo apt—get install tiger

To run tiger enter :

sudo tiger

All Tiger output can be found in the /var/log/tiger

To View the tiger security reports, open a Terminal and enter the following :

sudo less /var/log/tiger/security.report.*

Why do you suggest "magic
Submitted by n‘epb (bot bmﬂed) on Sat, 2073-03-09 77:29

Why do you suggest "magic_quotes_gpc On" P When you read php.ini comments, it is written that

the Off value is for production. Thanks

Thank you for pointing that
Submitted by Tbe Em Club on Sat, 2073-03-09 74:25

Thank you for pointing that out — It should be off, as this feature has been DEPRECATED as of
PHP 5.3.0 and REMOVED as of PHP 5.4.0. (see :
http: / /www.php.net/n1anual/en/ security.n1agicquotes.php)

This is a nice tutorial,
Submitted by dmm‘mé (bot bmﬂed) 0% F77, 2073-03-22 77:03

This is a nice tutorial, quick and easy, less explained, thanks for that! What imissed here also is the
security of email services like postfiX and generally a anti Virus tool. I mean use of clamav, postgrey
and so on. It would be nice if you spent time to write a part for that ;—) One that i believe is also
required for good security is to install suhosin for php. It would be nice if you add it to this guide,
and how to configure it with minimal settings. Also speak about disabling/enabling modules in php
that are mostly not used, or modules which can be turned off and on for special applications.
Another thing i ever see is enabled mods in apache that nobody uses (which can be simply disabled).
It would be nice if you speak about what is really needed, and how to disable/enable unused ones.
ModEvasive is also not really needed in favour of ModSecurity, which can also do DDOS prevention
for you. I did not test the rules of OWASP CRS yet since they are stated as experimental, but they
look clear to me. Take a look to file "modsecurity_crs_11_dos_protection". I use similar ones in

production environment...
