How To Monitor System Logins

A fundamental component of authentication management is monitoring the system after
you have configured your users.

Luckily, modern Linux systems log all authentication attempts in a discrete file. This is
located at "/var/log/auth.log":

sudo less /var/1og/auth.1og

May 3 18:20:45 localhost sshd[585]: Server listening on 0.0.0.0 port 22.
May 3 18:20:45 localhost sshd[585]: Server listening on :: port 22.

May 3 18:23:56 localhost login[673]: pam_unix(login:session): session
opened fo

r user root by LOGIN(uid=0)

May 3 18:23:56 localhost login[714]: ROOT LOGIN on '/dev/tty1'

Sep 5 13:49:07 localhost sshd[358]: Received signal 15; terminating.
Sep 5 13:49:07 localhost sshd[565]: Server listening on 0.0.0.0 port 22.
Sep 5 13:49:07 localhost sshd[565]: Server listening on :: port 22.

How To Use the "last" Command

Usually, you will only be interested in the most recent login attempts. You can see these
with the "last" tool:

last

demoer pts/l rrcs—72—43—115—1 Thu Sep 5 19:37 still logged in
root pts/l rrcs—72—43—115—1 Thu Sep 5 19:37 — 19:37 (00:00)
root pts/O rrcs—72—43—115—1 Thu Sep 5 19:15 still logged in
root pts/O rrcs—72—43—115—1 Thu Sep 5 18:35 — 18:44 (00:08)
root pts/O rrcs—72—43—115—1 Thu Sep 5 18:20 — 18:20 (00:00)
demoer pts/O rrcs—72—43—115—1 Thu Sep 5 18:19 — 18:19 (00:00)

This gives a formated version of the "letc/log/wtmp" file.

As you can see, in the first and third line, it shows that the user is still logged into the
system. Otherwise, the total time logged into the system during a session is given by a set
of hyphen—separated values.

How To Use the "lastlog" Command

If you would like to look at this situation from a different angle, you can view the last time
each user on the system logged in.

This information is provided by accessing the "/etc/log/lastlog" file. It is then sorted
according to the entries in the "/etc/passwd" file:

lastlog

Username Port From Latest

root pts/l rrcs—72—43—115—1 Thu Sep 5 19:37:02 +0000 2013
daemon **Never logged in**

bin **Never logged in**

sys **Never logged in**

sync **Never logged in**

games * *Never logged in* *

You can see the latest login time of every user on the system.

Notice how the system users will almost all have "**Never logged in**". We saw earlier how
these accounts do not have password authentication set up, so this is the expected value.

Conclusion

User authentication on Linux is a relatively flexible area of system management. There are
many ways of accomplishing the same objective with very simple tools.

It is important to understand where the system keeps information about logins so that you
can monitor your server for changes that do not reflect your usage.
